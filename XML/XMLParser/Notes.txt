XMLParser
This is a non-validating XML parser. It is fast and use very little memory.
It can be very handy to parse trusted files that are known to be valid in form.
The parser does not store, or create any structure with the XML data, instead it uses an interface 
and calls each method of that interface passing the XML Data.

To use the parser the IXmlNotify interface needs to be implemented.

It is easy to implement the IXmlNotify, just declare a class like

MyClass CLASS,IMPLEMENTS(IXmlNotify)
        END

And implement the IXmlNotify methods like:

MyClass.IXmlNotify.FoundNode           PROCEDURE( STRING name, STRING  attributes )
 CODE

In the methods you write the code that is needed every time the parser finds the data that you are interested in.
Remember that this is not a general poupose parser, so you will know exactly the data that you will be receiving.

After you have your class implemented just call the parser like:

lXMLParser XMLParser
LOC:XMLStream  STRING(1024)
 CODE
    lXMLParser.Parse(LOC:XMLStream,MyClass.IXmlNotify)
    
Note: you can declare your expected string at runtime based on the size of the xml file, or you can receive the stream from a web server,etc.
